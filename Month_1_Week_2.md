# Friday Breakout Session
### Date: October 06, 2017

## Agenda:

## 1. Finish Keith's github exercise from Monday (5 mins)
- Complete the exercise of creating the github repo for the month1 coursera project and commit a README.md file

## 2. Questions (20 mins)
- Let's use the first part of our meeting to answer questions about any of the material covered thus far

## 3. Key Concepts (5 mins)
- What should you be able to do at the end of this week

## 4. Group Work (30 mins)
- Let's split into two groups and work on the exercise for Month 1 Week 2 in [this repository](https://github.com/DanSPiltzer/Friday_Breakout_Exercises)
  - This exercise will get you more familiar with bringing in a csv, using dplyr and tidyr to clean the data, and using ggplot to visualize the data.  It should also give you another rep at using git.
- Last 10 minutes spent reviewing what each group got and how I solved it.
