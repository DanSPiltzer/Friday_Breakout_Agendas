# Friday Breakout Session
### Date: October 13, 2017

## Agenda:

## 1. rvdata Setup (5 mins)
- Ensure everyone is successfully set up with the rvdata package

## 2. Questions (20 mins)
- Let's use the first part of our meeting to answer questions about any of the material covered thus far

## 3. Key Concepts (5 mins)
- What should you be able to do at the end of this week

## 4. Group Work (30 mins)
- Let's split into two groups and work on the exercise for Month 1 Week 3 in [this repository](https://github.com/DanSPiltzer/Friday_Breakout_Exercises)
	- You can use the ```git pull``` command in the location where you cloned this repo last week to bring in the latest updates
	- This exercise will give you a chance to bring data in from sql server using the rvdata package and then use the skills you covered last week to manipulate said data.  There is a bonus at the end to plot the data in the best way you see fit.
- Last 10 minutes spent reviewing what each group got and how I solved it.
